- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrankiBrix
- 👀 I’m interested in starting a company with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS. Once I feel comfortable within the chosen relm I will branch out.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find others around the same stage as me to learn with, I'm a complete beginner. I've completed about %60 of the Codecademy.com HTML course and I took one college level course on the subject years ago.
